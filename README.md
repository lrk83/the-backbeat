## Elevator Pitch

The backbeat is a place for home producers to share and collect music production knowledge. 

There are fantastic resources for music production all over the internet, but tracking down and organizing them can be a bit of a headache. Music producers spend alot of time picking through Reddit, Youtube, or various Discord channels, and while this can be good fun, it can also get a bit frustrating. On the other hand, sites like Splice have tried to make more dedicated hubs for music production info, and while these include some great information, they don't fully capitalize on the wonderful capacity of crowdsourcing production knowledge. Home producers know better than anyone else what home producers want to know - so home producers are the best possible source of information for oneanother.

The Backbeat allows producers to post all their favorite music production resources from around the internet in one place, and pick up new resources from others. You can follow particular users who's tastes seem to line up with your own, or let the site recommend posts for you based on your specific interests. You can see which sample packs have been saved by the most people, post your own articles, or link to your own favorite plugins. If people really enjoy your specific recomendations they can get follow your profile, which will point more visitors in your direction.
